 Hero MotoCorp Valuation Using DCF Model

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to estimate the intrinsic value of Hero MotoCorp using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model. The DCF approach helps determine whether the stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by forecasting future cash flows and discounting them to the present value.

Gather and analyze financial data for Hero MotoCorp.
Project future free cash flows (FCFs) based on historical trends and market conditions.
Calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as the discount rate.
